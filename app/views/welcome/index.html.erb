It was clear that she had a strong dedication to her clients and took our requests seriously and always with a sense of urgency when that was required.

          “I was fortunate to engage the services of Miss Wolfe and the technical team she led, when I was Manager responsible for Worldwide Software eCommerce sales at IBM. We were looking for innovative ways to simplify our customers' software acquisition process. Miss Wolfe’s work, in guiding us toward our final solution, was groundbreaking, creative, and transformational. She, and her team, brought outstanding listening and state-of-the art solution skills to our development process and made significant contributions toward the attainment of our transformation goals. Miss Wolfe, in my experience, is an outstanding professional and would be a superb contributor to any business team.”

She was responsive, took the time to understand our business and needs, and made sure that we had the best resources aligned with our work.

          "I worked with Faye at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) where I was a program manager introducing user experience design services for the development of a mission critical IT project. This was the first time that ODNI had ever procured user experience design services and all eyes were on the performance of EffectiveUI, its principals, and me as the program manager. Faye acted as our managing director throughout the whole project. She is a strong team leader, highly knowledgeable, and able to explain technical concepts and direction with authority - all key factors in the success of the project. Faye is an extremely hard worker and dedicated to excellent client service - the government can be a demanding and our unique position in the Intelligence Community posed many challenges which Faye overcame like a pro. Our project could not have been successful without her leading the team and being my partner and advocate for applying UX in the government."
